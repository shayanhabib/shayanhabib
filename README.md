## Hi there 👋

I’m a Senior Full-Stack Developer with 13+ years of hands-on experience building scalable web and mobile applications.

My work spans PHP, Laravel, WordPress, React, React Native, and AWS, covering everything from backend architecture and APIs to modern web interfaces and cross-platform mobile apps (iOS & Android).

What I work on
- Scalable web applications and backend systems
- E-commerce platforms (custom builds, WooCommerce, Shopify integrations)
- React & React Native applications for web and mobile
- Custom WordPress plugins & themes
- REST APIs, third-party integrations, and performance optimization
- Cloud deployments on AWS

I care deeply about clean, maintainable code, thoughtful architecture, and solving real-world problems. Most of the repositories here reflect production patterns, experiments, or reusable components from real projects.
