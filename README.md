## Hi there 👋

I help businesses build scalable web and mobile platforms that are designed for growth — not just launch.

With 13+ years of experience in product engineering, I’ve worked with startups, agencies, and growing companies to turn ideas into reliable, high-performance digital products.

My focus isn’t just development.

It’s architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

I specialize in building:

- Custom web applications
- Scalable SaaS platforms
- E-commerce systems
- Cross-platform mobile apps (iOS & Android)
- Social & engagement-driven products

Using modern, proven technologies including Laravel, React, and React Native.

Over the years, I’ve:

- Built production-ready web & mobile apps from scratch
- Optimized and refactored large legacy systems
- Developed scalable APIs and backend architectures
- Delivered e-commerce platforms with custom integrations
- Designed systems ready for user growth and performance demands

I work comfortably across the full product lifecycle — from architecture planning and backend engineering to modern frontend interfaces and mobile app deployment.

What clients value most is not just technical delivery — but clear communication, structured execution, and a long-term product mindset.

If you’re building something serious — whether a business platform, SaaS product, or mobile application — I’m open to strategic conversations.
