## Hi there 👋

I’m a Senior Full-Stack Developer with 13+ years of experience building scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications. I specialize in PHP, Laravel, WordPress, React, and AWS, with a strong focus on e-commerce platforms, custom APIs, and system architecture.

I’ve worked on everything from custom WordPress plugins and large Laravel backends to React-based dashboards and Shopify integrations, always with an eye on clean code, performance, and long-term maintainability. I enjoy solving complex problems, refactoring legacy systems, and designing architectures that scale smoothly as products grow.

On GitHub, you’ll mostly find:
- Production-ready Laravel & PHP code
- WordPress plugins, custom themes, and performance optimizations
- React components and frontend utilities
- Experiments with AWS, APIs, and scalable backend patterns

I believe in writing code that lasts, documenting decisions, and continuously improving through real-world problem solving.
